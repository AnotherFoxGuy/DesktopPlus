Short version:
Any contribution is welcomed with open arms. In the rare case something would be off, it'll be taken care of.

Long version:
I want to preface this with stating that the Desktop+ code is no way trying to be professional. Just read the comments.
It's provided as-is, in hope somebody finds a use in it. 
The code grew with time, overall structure may not be up to best practice. If you want to re-organize it to be "better", feel free.

In terms of actually adding code, there are no strict style guidelines. Just don't make the code look foreign in the middle of the existing mess.
If you plan to add something big, consider opening an issue for it first.
I take some needless pride in the low memory footprint, both runtime and size on disk. Try to not add bloat without reason.
It's fine for code to be a tiny bit awkward in order to use system libraries instead of pulling megabytes of additional dependencies.
Perhaps also avoid stacks of abstraction. The code may run on typically beefy machines, but it's running in the background most of time. Make sane decisions.

Just felt like I should mention this stuff somewhere. Not like anyone reads this anyways.
